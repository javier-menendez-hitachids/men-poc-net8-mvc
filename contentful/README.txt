To merge the changes from your environment (privilege_VRDX) into the master environment, you can use the Contentful Merge app CLI. Here's the process:

    View the content type differences:
contentful merge show --te master --se privilege_VRDX

Export the differences as a migration file:
contentful merge export --te master --se privilege_VRDX

This command will generate a migration script file.

    Apply the differences to the master environment:

bash
contentful space migration --space <your-space-id> --environment master <path-to-migration-script>

Replace <your-space-id> with your actual space ID and <path-to-migration-script> with the path to the migration file generated in step 2. Before applying the changes, make sure to review the migration script to ensure it contains the desired modifications. It's also recommended to test the changes in a staging environment before applying them to the master environment
